Then we would allow the user to perform a handful of commands (such as print, sort, keyword search, time search, etc) to output a text file with only the logs they want. The main learning goal of this project was to understand the time complexities of different data structures and algorithms, as we had to fit all of the commands given within their relevant time allotment to pass the test.",tech:["C++"],color:"green"}]},{header:"2018",color:"blue",projects:[{title:"image_card",images:["images/content_resize.jpg"]},{title:"Content-Aware Image Resizing",preview:"Still to this day, the concept of this program is insanely cool to me.",description:"This was a tool that parsed individual pixels of an image and calculated the contrast between its surrounding pixels. Depending on the input you give the program (output length/width, crop/resize), it uses the contrast between sections of the image to decide where we can afford to resize an image without distorting its significant parts too much. The idea behind this project was to find unimportant areas in the image that we can use to resize the image in hopes of changing the contents of the image as little as possible from the perspective of the viewer.",tech:["C++"],color:"blue"},{title:"image_card",images:["images/euchre.jpg"]},{title:"Euchre Simulator",preview:"This program simulated Euchre (a complex card game popular in Michigan) between 2 human players, or a few flavors of AI.",description:"It was my first project that was too large and complex to this about all at once. You had to break it up and use a wonderful thing called abstraction, which assumes that the other components of your program would work correctly (spoiler: they didn't). This was probably one of my most memorable projects, as my partner and I stayed up to coding until around 5 am to finish the project early for an upcoming busy week. It had countless edge cases that you had to account for and was my first introduction to more advanced debugging tools.",tech:["C++"],color:"orange"},{title:"image_card",images:["images/piazzaclassifier.jpg"]},{title:"Piazza Post Classifier",description:"The Piazza Post Classifier took in a large number of forum posts from Piazza and used natural language processing with a dataset of prelabeled Piazza posts to generate connections between common keywords and their labels. Further posts can be entered into the program which then returns its prediction on the suggested topic the classifier thinks the post is from.

You can find more 'normal' versions too, like RPS-15 and RPS-25 (I actually programmed those first and that's what led me to RPS-101).

You could make your robot have some personality as well - I know a few people who made their robot drive in circles, waiting until one person got close enough before it relentlessly chased them down with melee attacks.
